# Hi!

Nice to meet you! I’m Tomasz (or Thomas, if you prefer). As a full-stack developer with over three years of experience, I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS, and React, building clean, efficient code that powers features users genuinely enjoy. Seeing technical ideas come to life—and knowing they make a difference—is what keeps me passionate about development. Working with teams from around the globe brings fresh perspectives and inspiration to every project.

When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me off-road on my mountain bike, perfecting my coffee brew, conquering board game worlds, or unwinding with a good series. 

Welcome to my corner of the internet—dive into the blog if you’re curious about my thoughts on tech, teamwork, and more!
